            One of the things Iâ€™m most looking forward to in opening The Tiny Beet is spending more time with my patients.
            A DPC model, similar to a concierge style, allows for this tailored experience and works as a monthly membership.
            These are some of its advantages: 
          </p>
          { (breakpoints.md || breakpoints. l) && <DPCButton /> }
