          <h1>The Lifestyle Medicine Approach</h1>
          <p>
            Lifestyle Medicine is the specialty I came across that ultimately
            pushed me to open my own practice. LM treats each patient from the
            root cause by focusing on its pillars: eating healthy (weâ€™re big
            fans of plant-based meals), having fun with physical activity, the
            importance of sleep, harvesting healthy relationships, stress
            management, and avoiding substances.
          </p>

            Below are some Lifestyle Medicine resources I highly recommend:
